You are receiving this email because you are in violation of ACI standard 3.5.01. The ACI standard regarding the termination process, requires managers to initiate a termination action via the Manager Self Service” in Oracle HCM prior to the employees termination date.  Your failure to submit on time has caused this employee to retain access to ACI systems and networks, which in turn has weakened ACI’s security posture and potentially jeopardized ACI’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.  

Your ELT leader will also be notified of this failure. 

ACI standard 3.1.02 states that violations or disregarding the responsibilities and standards documented in the Information Security Policy could be grounds for disciplinary actions, up to and including termination.
